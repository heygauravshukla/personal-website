            from the Play Store, and started building websites right from my
            mobile device. That was the beginning of my journey into web
            development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I learned the basics by taking notes, experimenting constantly, and
            building small web pages on my own.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2021, I got my first computer for my engineering studies. While
            learning tools like AutoCAD as part of the curriculum, I explored
            different engineering subjects but always found myself drawn toward
            where technology meets human interaction — the frontend.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although I was pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and
            Engineering, web technologies were never formally part of my
            curriculum. Most of what I know today came from self-learning,
            YouTube tutorials, documentation, and building projects
            independently.

            whose content helped me strengthen my frontend fundamentals.

          <h2>Growth and Experience</h2>

          <p>
            During campus placements, I appeared for several companies, but many
            filtering processes never truly reflected my practical skills and
            learning journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            Realizing the growing demand in the industry, I focused on
            strengthening my core frontend skills. I explored JavaScript in
            depth — a language I initially avoided because of my strong love for
            CSS — and later started working more with React.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2025, after building several mini projects, I moved toward
            API-driven applications using Next.js to understand real-world
            development challenges such as CORS, API routes, SSR, and clean code
            practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            During this phase, I built projects like my{" "}

            , multiple mini applications, and this personal website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually, I got an opportunity from{" "}

            despite having no prior professional experience. I joined as a

            for October 2025.

          <p>That moment meant a lot to me.</p>

          <p>
            Currently, I work as a full-time Junior Frontend Developer at RWIT.
            I enjoy sharing my learnings, experiences, and ideas through social
            media and this personal blog whenever I get time.
          </p>

          <h2>Philosophy</h2>

          <p>
            I believe frontend development is more than just writing code — it
            is about creating experiences that feel intuitive, thoughtful, and
            human.
          </p>

          <p>
            My focus is on building clean, accessible, and performant interfaces
            while continuously improving my understanding of design and software
            engineering.
          </p>
