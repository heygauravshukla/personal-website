        <p>
          We aim to collect as little personal information as necessary. The
          Site may collect:
        </p>
        <h3>a) Automatically Collected Information</h3>
        <p>
          The Site does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising cookies. Our
          hosting provider may automatically log basic technical information as
          part of standard server operation, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP address</li>
          <li>Browser type and version</li>
          <li>Device type and operating system</li>
          <li>Date and time of access</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This information is used only for security, troubleshooting, and
          maintaining the Site, and is not used to track or profile individual
          visitors.
        </p>
        <h3>b) Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>
          The Site does not have a contact form. If you reach out via the email
          address or social media links provided on the Site, we may receive
          your name, email address (or social media handle), and any information
          you choose to include in your message. We do not knowingly collect
          sensitive personal information (such as financial, health, or
          government ID data) through this Site.
        </p>
      </>

      <>
        <p>
          The Site does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking cookies, and
          does not use any non-essential cookies. Because we do not set
          non-essential cookies, we do not use a cookie consent banner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our hosting provider may use strictly necessary technical mechanisms
          to serve the Site reliably, but these do not track you across sessions
          or websites. If this changes in the future (for example, if we add
          analytics tools), we will update this section and implement an
          appropriate consent mechanism.
